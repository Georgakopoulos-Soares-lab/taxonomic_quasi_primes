## Overview
This repository contains the analysis pipeline and findings for identifying unique peptide sequences, termed **taxonomic quasi-prime peptides**, that are specific to taxonomic groups. By analyzing proteomes across 24,073 species, the study identifies these peptides unique to superkingdoms, kingdoms, and phyla, offering insights into evolutionary divergence and functional roles.

## Key Objectives
1. **Identification of Taxonomic Quasi-Prime Peptides:**
   - Define k-mer peptides (short peptide sequences of length k) exclusive to specific taxonomic groups.
   - Assess their frequency and uniqueness across taxonomic levels (e.g., superkingdom, kingdom, phylum).

2. **Functional Analysis:**
   - Map quasi-prime peptides to proteins.
   - Perform multi-Phylum Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment to uncover their biological significance.
   - Perform multi-Phylum protein domain and protein family enrichment analyses integrating InterPro data.

3. **Structural Insights:**
   - Analyze secondary and tertiary structures of proteins containing quasi-prime peptides.
   - Explore taxon-specific protein modifications and adaptations.

4. **Applications:**
   - Highlight the potential of quasi-prime peptides in healthcare, biotechnology, and evolutionary research.
